Objectives:
    - Danish + english static blog generation, side by side.
- User writes the danish and the english.
    - Body is text only.
    - Include a 'mood'.
    - Include a title.
- Image can be added to the post (will appear at top).
- Links can be added to the post (will appear at the bottom).
- Index page to find all posts (updated on each post).
    - Update last post to point to current post when new post added.
- Generate by running /usr/local/bin/post; if web dir isn't writable, scream with appropriately helpful message (e.g. chown -R madda:www /var/www/htdocs/madda/pub)

Steps:
    1. Create main page with with 2x test content.
    2. Determine directory structure to access single posts. (json containing content maybe, though that means using python to parse; shell parseable might be nicer?; handle images later)
    3. Determine how to update last post- maybe surround it in html comments to make it easy to sed.
    4. Make script.
5. Handle images.
6. Handle links.
    7. Mood.
